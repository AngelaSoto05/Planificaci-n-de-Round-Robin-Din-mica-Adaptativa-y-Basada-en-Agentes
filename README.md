# AGENT-BASED-ADAPTIVE-DYNAMIC-ROUND-ROBIN-SCHEDULING
Implementation of the Agent-Based Adaptive Dynamic Round Robin (AADRR) Scheduling Algorithm, designed to optimize CPU process scheduling. Unlike traditional Round Robin, AADRR adapts dynamically to system load and process behavior using agent-based decision-making, improving turnaround time, waiting time, and CPU utilization.
